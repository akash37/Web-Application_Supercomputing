    <p><b>Distributed Memory</b>
<strong>General Characteristics:</strong>
<UL>
<LI>Like shared memory systems, distributed memory systems vary widely but 
    share a common characteristic. Distributed memory systems require a 
    communication network to connect inter-processor memory.



<LI>Processors have their own local memory.  Memory addresses in one 
    processor do not map to another processor, so there is no concept of
    global address space across all processors.

<LI>Because each processor has its own local memory, it operates 
    independently. Changes it makes to its local memory have no effect
    on the memory of other processors.  Hence, the concept of cache
    coherency does not apply.

<LI>When a processor needs access to data in another processor, it is 
    usually the task of the programmer to explicitly define how and when
    data is communicated.  Synchronization between tasks is likewise the
    programmer's responsibility.

<LI>The network "fabric" used for data transfer varies widely, though it can
    be as simple as Ethernet.
