<strong>Advantages of Distributed Memory:</strong>
    <UL>
    <LI>Memory is scalable with the number of processors. Increase the number of    
        processors and the size of memory increases proportionately. 
    <LI>Each processor can rapidly access its own memory without interference
        and without the overhead incurred with trying to maintain global cache
        coherency.
    <LI>Cost effectiveness: can use commodity, off-the-shelf processors and
        networking.
    </UL>
<strong>Disadvantages of Distributed Memory:</strong>
    <UL>
    <LI>The programmer is responsible for many of the details associated with
        data communication between processors. 
    <LI>It may be difficult to map existing data structures, based on global
        memory, to this memory organization. 
    <LI>Non-uniform memory access times - data residing on a remote node
        takes longer to access than node local data.
    </UL>
