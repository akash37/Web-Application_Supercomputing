MPI COMPILERS<br>
				History and Evolution: 
MPI has resulted from the efforts of numerous individuals and groups that began in 1992.<br> 
Some history:<br>
1980s - early 1990s: Distributed memory, parallel computing develops, as do a number of incompatible software tools for writing such programs - usually with tradeoffs between portability, performance, functionality and price. Recognition of the need for a standard arose
Apr 1992: Workshop on Standards for Message Passing in a Distributed Memory Environment, sponsored by the Center for Research on Parallel Computing, Williamsburg, Virginia. The basic features essential to a standard message passing interface were discussed, and a working group established to continue the standardization process. Preliminary draft proposal developed subsequently.
Nov 1992: Working group meets in Minneapolis. MPI draft proposal (MPI1) from ORNL presented. Group adopts procedures and organization to form the MPI Forum. It eventually comprised of about 175 individuals from 40 organizations including parallel computer vendors, software writers, academia and application scientists.
Nov 1993: Supercomputing 93 conference - draft MPI standard presented<br>
May 1994: Final version of MPI-1.0 released<br>
			MPI-1.1 (Jun 1995)<br>
			MPI-1.2 (Jul 1997)<br>
			MPI-1.3 (May 2008).<br>
1998: MPI-2 picked up where the first MPI specification left off, and addressed topics which went far beyond the MPI-1 specification<br>
			MPI-2.1 (Sep 2008)<br>
			MPI-2.2 (Sep 2009)<br>
Sep 2012: The MPI-3.0 standard was approved<br>
			MPI-3.1 (Jun 2015)<br>
