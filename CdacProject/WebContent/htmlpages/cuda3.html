  <strong>Limitations</strong><br><br>
1.CUDA does not support the full C standard, as it runs
 host code through a C++ compiler, which makes some valid C 
(but invalid C++) code fail to compile<br><br>
2.Interoperability with rendering languages such as OpenGL
 is one-way, with OpenGL having access to registered CUDA memory
 but CUDA not having access to OpenGL memory.<br><br>
3.Copying between host and device memory may 
incur a performance hit due to system bus bandwidth
 and latency (this can be partly alleviated with asynchronous
 memory transfers, handled by the GPU's DMA engine)<br><br>
4.Threads should be running in groups of at least 32
 for best performance, with total number of threads numbering
 in the thousands. Branches in the program code do not affect 
performance significantly, provided that each of 32 threads takes
 the same execution path; the SIMD execution model becomes a 
significant limitation for any inherently divergent task
 (e.g. traversing a space partitioning data structure during ray tracing).<br><br>
5.Unlike OpenCL, CUDA-enabled GPUs are only available from Nvidia.<br><br>
6.No emulator or fallback functionality is available for modern revisions.<br><br>
7.Valid C/C++ may sometimes be flagged and prevent
 compilation due to optimization techniques the compiler 
is required to employ to use limited resources.<br><br>
8.A single process must run spread across multiple disjoint memory
 spaces, unlike other C language runtime environments.<br><br>
9.C++ Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) is not supported in CUDA code,
 due to lack of support in the underlying hardware.<br><br>
10.Exception handling is not supported in CUDA code due to performance 
overhead that would be incurred with many thousands of parallel threads running.<br><br>
11.CUDA (with compute capability 2.x) allows a subset of C++ class
 functionality, for example member functions may not be virtual
 (this restriction will be removed in some future release).<br><br>
