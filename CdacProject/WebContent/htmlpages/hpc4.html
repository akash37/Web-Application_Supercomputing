     <p><b>Who is Using Parallel Computing?</b><br>
Science and Engineering<br>
Historically, parallel computing has been considered to be "the high end of computing", and has been used to
model difficult problems in many areas of science and engineering:<br>
Atmosphere, Earth, Environment<br>
Physics applied,nuclear, particle, condensed matter, high pressure, fusion, photonics<br>
Bioscience, Biotechnology, Genetics<br>
Chemistry, Molecular Sciences<br>
Geology, Seismology<br>
Mechanical Engineering from prosthetics to spacecraft<br>
Electrical Engineering, Circuit Design,Microelectronics<br>
Computer Science, Mathematics<br>
Defense, Weapon</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial:
Today, commercial applications provide an equal or greater driving force in the development of faster
computers. These applications require the processing of large amounts of data in sophisticated ways. For
example:<br>
"Big Data", databases, data mining<br>
Oil exploration<br>
Web search engines, web based<br>
business services<br>
Medical imaging and diagnosis<br>
Financial and economic modeling<br>
