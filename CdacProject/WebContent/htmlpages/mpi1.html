    <p><b>What is MPI?</b><br>
a)M P I = Message Passing Interface<br>
b)MPI is a specification for the developers and users of message passing libraries. 
By itself, it is NOT a library - but rather the specification of what such a library should be.<br>
c)MPI primarily addresses the message-passing parallel programming model: data is moved from the
 address space of one process to that of another process through cooperative operations on each process.<br>
d)Simply stated, the goal of the Message Passing Interface is to provide a widely used standard for writing message passing programs.
The interface attempts to be:<br>
	Practical<br>
	Portable<br>
	Efficient<br>
	Flexible<br>
e)The MPI standard has gone through a number of revisions, with the most recent version being MPI-3.x <br>
f)Interface specifications have been defined for C and Fortran90 language bindings:<br>
	C++ bindings from MPI-1 are removed in MPI-3<br>
	MPI-3 also provides support for Fortran 2003 and 2008 features<br>
g)Actual MPI library implementations differ in which version and features of the MPI standard they support. Developers/users will need to be aware of this.<br>
