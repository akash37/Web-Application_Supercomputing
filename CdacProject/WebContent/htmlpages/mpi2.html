      <p><b>Programming Model:</b><br>
a)Originally, MPI was designed for distributed memory architectures, which were becoming increasingly popular at that time (1980s - early 1990s).<br>
b)As architecture trends changed, shared memory SMPs were combined over networks creating hybrid distributed memory / shared memory systems.<br>
c)MPI implementors adapted their libraries to handle both types of underlying memory architectures seamlessly. They also adapted/developed ways of handling different interconnects and protocols<br>
d)Today, MPI runs on virtually any hardware platform:<br>
	Distributed Memory<br>
	Shared Memory<br>
	Hybrid<br>
e)The programming model clearly remains a distributed memory model however, regardless of the underlying physical architecture of the machine.<br>
f)All parallelism is explicit: the programmer is responsible for correctly identifying parallelism and implementing parallel algorithms using MPI constructs.<br>
