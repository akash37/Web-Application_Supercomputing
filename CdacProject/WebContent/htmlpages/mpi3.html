      <p><b>Reasons for Using MPI:</b><br>
Standardization - MPI is the only message passing library that can be considered a standard. It is supported on virtually all HPC platforms. Practically, it has replaced all previous message passing libraries.<br>
Portability - There is little or no need to modify your source code when you port your application to a different platform that supports (and is compliant with) the MPI standard.<br>
Performance Opportunities - Vendor implementations should be able to exploit native hardware features to optimize performance. Any implementation is free to develop optimized algorithms.<br>
Functionality - There are over 430 routines defined in MPI-3, which includes the majority of those in MPI-2 and MPI-1.
	 Most MPI programs can be written using a dozen or less routines<br>
Availability - A variety of implementations are available, both vendor and public domain.<br></p>
<p><b>Getting Started</b><br>
	MPI include file -->program begins -->Initialize MPI Environment-->Do work and make message passing calls-->Terminate MPI Environment-->program ends<br>
 	Header File:<br>
		Required for all programs that make MPI library calls.
		C include file: #include "mpi.h" <br>
	Format of MPI Calls: <br>C names are case sensitive; Fortran names are not.
				Programs must not declare variables or functions with names beginning with the prefix MPI_ or PMPI_ (profiling interface).<br>
	Communicators and Groups:<br>
				MPI uses objects called communicators and groups to define which collection of processes may communicate with each other.
				Most MPI routines require you to specify a communicator as an argument.
				Communicators and groups will be covered in more detail later. For now, simply use MPI_COMM_WORLD whenever a communicator is required - it is the predefined communicator that includes all of your MPI processes.
     Rank:<br>  Within a communicator, every process has its own unique, integer identifier assigned by the system when the process initializes. A rank is sometimes also called a "task ID". Ranks are contiguous and begin at zero.
		Used by the programmer to specify the source and destination of messages. Often used conditionally by the application to control program execution (if rank=0 do this / if rank=1 do that).
