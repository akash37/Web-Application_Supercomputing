<p><b>Goals of OpenMP</b><br>
Standardization:<br>
Provide a standard among a variety of shared memory architectures/platforms<br>
Jointly defined and endorsed by a group of major computer hardware and software vendors
Lean and Mean:<br>
Establish a simple and limited set of directives for programming shared memory machines.<br>
Significant parallelism can be implemented by using just 3 or 4 directives.<br>
This goal is becoming less meaningful with each new release, apparently.<br>
Ease of Use:<br>
Provide capability to incrementally parallelize a serial program, unlike message-passing libraries which typically require an all or nothing approach<br>
Provide the capability to implement both coarse-grain and fine-grain parallelism<br>
Portability:<br>
The API is specified for C/C++ and Fortran<br>
Public forum for API and membership<br>
Most major platforms have been implemented including Unix/Linux platforms and Windows<br>
