<p><b>OpenMP Programming Model</b><br>
Shared Memory Model:<br>
	OpenMP is designed for multi-processor/core, shared memory machines.<br>
Thread Based Parallelism:<br>
	OpenMP programs accomplish parallelism exclusively through the use of threads.<br>
A thread of execution is the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system. The idea of a subroutine that can be scheduled to run autonomously might help explain what a thread is.<br>
Threads exist within the resources of a single process. Without the process, they cease to exist.<br>
Typically, the number of threads match the number of machine processors/cores. However, the actual use of threads is up to the application.<br>
OpenMP is an explicit (not automatic) programming model, offering the programmer full control over parallelization.<br>
Parallelization can be as simple as taking a serial program and inserting compiler directive...<br>
Or as complex as inserting subroutines to set multiple levels of parallelism, locks and even nested locks.<br>
Compiler Directive Based:<br>
	Most OpenMP parallelism is specified through the use of compiler directives which are imbedded in C/C++ or Fortran source code.<br>
Fork - Join Model:<br>
	OpenMP uses the fork-join model of parallel execution:<br> 
All OpenMP programs begin as a single process: the master thread. The master thread executes sequentially until the first parallel region construct is encountered.
FORK: the master thread then creates a team of parallel threads.<br>
The statements in the program that are enclosed by the parallel region construct are then executed in parallel among the various team threads.<br>
JOIN: When the team threads complete the statements in the parallel region construct, they synchronize and terminate, leaving only the master thread.<br>
The number of parallel regions and the threads that comprise them are arbitrary.<br>
