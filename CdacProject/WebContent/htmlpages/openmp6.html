The SINGLE directive<br>
	a)The SINGLE directive specifies that the enclosed code is to be executed by only one thread in the team<br>
	b)May be useful when dealing with sections of code that are not thread safe (such as I/O)<br>
The CRITICAL directive<br>
	The CRITICAL directive specifies a region of code that must be executed by only one thread at a time<br>
	If a thread is currently executing inside a CRITICAL region and another thread reaches that<br>
	CRITICAL region and attempts to execute it, it will block until the first thread exits that CRITICAL region.<br>
