<p><b>The Problem</b><br>
        PC speed increased 500 times since 1981, but today's software is more complex and still hungry for more resources<br>
        How to run faster on same hardware and OS architecture?<br>
        Highly optimized applications run tens times faster than poorly written ones.<br>
        Using efficient algorithms and well-designed implementations  leads to high performance applications</p>
<p><b>Extreme Optimization Pitfalls</b><br>
        Large application's performance cannot be improved before it runs<br>
        Build the application then see what machine it runs on<br>
        Runs great on my computer.<br>
        Debug versus release builds<br>
        Performance requires assembly language programming<br>
        Code features first then optimize if there is time leftover<br>
        Note:Software optimization doesn't begin where coding ends.
        It is ongoing process that starts at design stage and continues all the way through development
</p>
<p><b>The Benchmark</b>
    The benchmark is program that used to:<br>
        Objectively evaluate performance of an application<br>
        Provide repeatable application behavior for use with performance analysis tools<br>
    Industry standard benchmarks:<br>
      TPC-C 3D-Winbench <br>
      http://www.specbench.com/<br> 
      Enterprise Services <br>
      Graphics/Applications <br>
      HPC/OMP <br>
      Java Client/Server<br> 
      Mail Servers <br>
      Network File System<br> 
      Web Servers<br></p>
<p><b>Attributes of good benchmark</b><br>
    Repeatable (consistent measurements)<br>
      Remember system tasks , caching issues<br>
      "incoming fax" problem : use minimum performance number<br>
    Representative<br>
      Execution of typical code path, mimic how customer uses the application<br>
      Poor benchmarks : Using QA tests <br>
    Easy to run<br>
    Verifiable <br>
      need QA for benchmark!
    Measure Elapsed Time vs. other number
    Use benchmark to test functionality
      Algorithmic tricks to gain performance may break the application…
      </p>
<p><b>How to find performance bottlenecks</b><br>
    Determine how your system resources, such as memory and processor, are being utilized to identify system-level bottlenecks<br>
    Measure the execution time for each module and function in your application<br>
    Determine how the various modules running on your system affect the performance of each other<br>
    Identify the most time-consuming function calls and call sequences within your application<br>
    Determine how your application is executing at the processor level to identify microarchitecture-level performance problems<br>
